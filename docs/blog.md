# My First Machine Learning Project 
As the title of this page might suggest, I spend the last semester learning about machine learning in an elective module called "Creating Rich User Experiences with Applied Machine Learning". Prior to this class, I haven’t done anything with ML other than watching a couple of videos on YouTube out of curiosity.

## The problem
The problem I spend time on working was audio style transfer. Like normal image style transfer, audio style transfer takes two files, a content and a style, and tries to adjust the content file in a way that it fits the style.  

To gain a deeper understanding of the general concepts of style transfer, I also worked on image style transfer a bit. Here’s an example to help clarify the concept.

My project deals with translating this approach of style transfer from images to audio. However, since this was technically my first ML project, I used [this seedbank seed](https://research.google.com/seedbank/seed/audio_style_transfer) by Parag K. Mital as a basis. The author of the seed shows a novel approach that expands on [the work](https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/audio-texture-synthesis-and-style-transfer/) of Dmitry Ulyanov and Vadim Lebedev and is able to generate results that are a lot less noisy.
