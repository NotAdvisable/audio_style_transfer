# My First Machine Learning Project 
As the title of this page might suggest, I spend the last semester learning about machine learning in an elective module called "Creating Rich User Experiences with Applied Machine Learning". Prior to this class, I haven’t done anything with ML other than watching a couple of videos on YouTube out of curiosity.

## The problem
The problem I spend time on working was audio style transfer. Like normal image style transfer, audio style transfer takes two files, a content and a style, and tries to adjust the content file in a way that it fits the style.
To gain a deeper understanding of the general concepts of style transfer, I also worked on image style transfer a bit. Here’s an example to help clarify the concept.
