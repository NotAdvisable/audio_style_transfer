# My First Machine Learning Project 
As the title of this page might suggest, I spend the last semester learning about machine learning in an elective module called "Creating Rich User Experiences with Applied Machine Learning". Prior to this class, I haven’t done anything with ML other than watching a couple of videos on YouTube out of curiosity.

## What I Learned in Class
The class began with a small introduction to the history of deep learning.  and exercises

### Framing the Problem
The problem I spend time on working was audio style transfer. Like normal image style transfer, audio style transfer takes two files, a content and a style, and tries to adjust the content file in a way that it fits the style.  
Style transfer is an optimisation problem. The model keeps track of content loss and style loss. It then strives to preserve as much of the content as possible while also trying to preserve as much of the style as possible.
My project was more of experimental nature, but I still aimed to achieve more 

## What I Did
To gain a deeper understanding of the general concepts of style transfer, I also worked on image style transfer a bit. Here’s one of the images I created in the process.

My project deals with translating this approach of style transfer from images to audio. However, since this was technically my first ML project, I used [this seedbank seed](https://research.google.com/seedbank/seed/audio_style_transfer) by Parag K. Mital as a basis. The author of the seed shows a novel approach that expands on [the work](https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/audio-texture-synthesis-and-style-transfer/) of Dmitry Ulyanov and Vadim Lebedev and is able to generate results that are a lot less noisy.
